elektroinstallation monopohl started in 2020 when ls22 and luis oala began to explore music together. creating and discovering sounds in berlin, we naturally gravitate towards thick basslines, snappy drums, and the hypnotic elements of house, italo disco, and indie dance.
<br>
together, we look for new music and artists, release music, and dj at parties. we are drawn to sounds that bridge different eras and styles - from dusty drum machines to modern synth textures. when we play, expect to hear everything from forgotten italo gems to fresh house cuts that caught our ear.
