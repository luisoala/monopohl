elektroinstallation monopohl started in 2020 when ls22 and luis oala began to explore music together. creating and discovering sounds in berlin, we naturally gravitated towards thick basslines, snappy drums, and the hypnotic elements of house and italo disco.
<br>
<br>
together, we look for new music and artists, produce tracks, dj at parties, and organize events. we're drawn to sounds that bridge different eras and styles - from dusty drum machines to modern synth textures. when we play, expect to hear everything from forgotten italo gems to fresh house cuts that caught our ear.
