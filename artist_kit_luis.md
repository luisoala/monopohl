### luis oala
<br>
berlin-based dj and producer luis oala gravitates towards melodic, high-energy sets that blur the lines between house, italo disco, and indie dance. his sound is built on thick basslines, snappy drums, and hypnotic grooves that bridge eras and styles.
<br>
together with [ls22](22_bln), he co-founded *elektroinstallation monopohl* as a playground for forward-driving electronic music. through the project, he's become known for unearthing everything from dusty drum machine classics to fresh house cuts, creating sets where vintage italo gems collide with cutting-edge house. the label's pohlcast series has featured artists like dynamic d, neurotiker, reset, and audio vacanze, showcasing both established and emerging talent.
